    <h1>making videos can seem daunting. let me make it easier.</h1>
    <p>getting into video making can be hella intimidating. i get it. the gear is expensive,
        the software is confusing, and there is no concrete way to know if you're "doing it 
        right". thankfully, there are resources and people out there who can help you. here,
        i've compiled the most helpful videos, articles, and tidbits that i've picked up
        in my efforts to improve my process. if you have even the slightest interest in
        trying your hand at this, check out what i've included for you down below.
    </p>
    <p>*disclaimer: the following information comes from a self-taught hobbyist who hasn't had
        any formal training. it's highly unlikely that everything i've included is the best 
        advice. hell, i may be completely wrong in some cases and i won't realize it until later  
        in the future. the best teacher is experience, so wake up, go make cool shit, and 
        keep learning how to make even cooler shit.

        <h3>what i'm using for each context</h3>
        <p>over the past year, i've been switching back and forth between the three software 
            options listed <a href="resources.html">here</a> depending on what i'm trying to 
            do.
        </p>
        <p>if i need to get something done quick and i want a fast workflow, i'm using FCPX</p>
        <p>if i'm trying something new or complex, most likely i'm trying it on premiere pro 
            primarily bc it was the first professional software i used, and i'm used to it the 
            most.
        </p>
        <p>when i was the chair for the video committee of a student org, we used davinci 
            resolve because it was free.
        </p>
        <h3>how to edit videos</h3>
        <p>it's hard to get all the information on this page that would help you learn video 
            editing. so, i've instead included a youtube playlist of basically every video that 
            gave me tips and tutorials on anything related to videography. it's been slowly 
            growing since i was in 11th grade, so there's a ton of great stuff in there. check 
            it out <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL48T5EsThQ1fTs-rjJJlKPzsbBC6b5ont">here</a> 
            because it's been crucial to me over the years. 
        </p>
        <h3>exporting/publishing your video</h3>
        <p>how you export your video can change based on the platform you're planning to 
            publish it on.
        </p>
        <p>for example, i've been recording in vertical format when i know i'm making a video 
            for instagram. this way, it shows up on the feed taking up more real estate on the 
            screen. it also offers a more seamless viewing experience when you can just watch 
            the vieo in the feed and then expand it to fill up the screen without having to rotate 
            your phone. most of the time, you're recording and exporting in horizontal format to fit desktop 
            and tv screens. 
        </p>
        <p>here's a kicker - not all platforms are created equal when publishing a video. some 
            are more friendly than others. youtube and vimeo are the most friendly as in they 
            won't compress your video and instead will display it in it's full quality. instagram 
            and facebook on the other hand aren't as nice. there is nothing more frustrating than 
            making a high quality video and then watching instagram's compression absolutely kill 
            it. something worth mentioning related to this - IGTV is the way to go for videos. if 
            your video is over a minute long, you can release it on instagram as an IGTV and more 
            of the video quality is retained.
