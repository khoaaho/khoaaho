    <h1 id="intro-title">making videos can seem daunting. let me make it easier.</h1>
    <p id="intro-body">i get it. the gear is expensive,
        the software is confusing, and there is no concrete way to know if you're "doing it 
        right". here, i've compiled the most helpful videos, articles, and tidbits that i've picked up
        in my efforts to improve my process.

        <h3 id="the-idea">the idea</h3>
        <p>why are you making this video? it's the first question that you answer and without 
            an answer, there is no direction. this purpose or idea can come in many forms. you 
            may need to promote an event, or you could be making a reflection type of video from 
            the past year. there have been times where i've just had an editing concept that i 
            wanted to try out. whatever your purpose is, that is the north star that drives all 
            of your creative decisions.
        </p>
        <h3 id="video-treatments">video treatments</h3>
        <p>video treatments are a great way to plan out what you are doing before you start 
            recording and editing footage. without a treatment, i've found that i take much 
            longer getting footage, and my editing takes longer because i hadn't planned ahead.
        </p>
        <p>treatments can take many forms, and there's really no rules to it as long as it's 
            helping you stay organized so you know what you're doing going into the next phase.
            for reference, a video treatment i made for an event can be found 
            <a id="treatment-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iQSe0a1HolKTYsQiLRAPc4hQAVs9nhG8/view?usp=sharing">here</a>
        </p>
        <h3 id="camera-settings">camera settings</h3>
        <p>ok, here's a crash course on camera settings when recording footage. first off, 
            there are five main attributes that you control when shooting both video and photos:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="setting-example">aperture</li>
            <li class="setting-example">ISO</li>
            <li class="setting-example">frame rate</li>
            <li class="setting-example">shutter speed</li>
            <li class="setting-example">video resolution</li>
        </ol>
        <p>aperture is expressed with an "f/insert_number_here". the number can range anywhere 
            from 1.0 to 22.0 depending on the lens and the lower the number, the 
            wider the lens opening is, which means more light comes in. when you see photos like 
            <a id="aperture-link" href="images/lowAperture.jpeg">this</a> with the buttery blurred background that 
            looks sooo cinematic, that's from a low aperture (this one was prob taken at an 
            aperture around f/2.4). also a note on gear, the aperture you see listed in the name
            of a lens is the lowest aperture it can go to. so my Tamron lens found <a id="resources-link" href="resources.html">here</a>
            goes from f/22 to f/2.8.
        </p>
        <p>ISO is purely how much light a camera sensor takes in. for my camera, it can range 
            from 100 to 51200. the higher the number, the more light comes in. so we have two 
            attributes (aperture and ISO) that affects lighting. so if you are going for a 
            low aperture, you're going to have to account for that with a low ISO.
        </p>
        <p>frame rate is determined by the type of look you want. for most movies you see 
            in theaters, the footage is recorded in 24 frames per second (fps) or 30 fps. however, 
            if you want some slow motion, you want to record at a higher fps so that when you slow 
            down the footage to either 24 fps or 30 fps, it doesn't look choppy. for example, 
            if i recorded something at 60 fps and made it run at 40% speed, i am bringing my footage 
            back to 24 fps (24 is 40% of 60) and it still looks smooth. for hella slow motion, i'll 
            record footage at 120 fps and slow it down to 20% speed.
        </p>
        <p>shutter speed is entirely dependent upon frame rate. it's expressed as "1/insert_number" 
            and the golden rule is that your number needs to be roughly double your frame rate. for 
            example, when i record at 24 fps, my shutter speed is 1/50. for 120 fps, my shutter speed is 
            1/240. it doesn't have to be exactly double, but choose the one that is closest to it.
        </p>
        <p>video resolution is almost always 4k for me and 1080p when i'm recording at higher 
            frame rates (bc my camera can't support 4k at 120 fps). the higher the resolution, 
            the more detail you get and cropping is less of an issue. however, larger resolutions 
            = larger file sizes. so keep that in mind.
        </p>
        <h3 id="things-to-try">things to try - and things to avoid</h3>
        <p>the following are a list of little tips i've picked up:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="tip-example">never delete any footage until editing. that little LED screen on the camera 
                won't show you the whole picture, and you also don't 100% know what you will 
                use in post.
            </li>
            <li class="tip-example">bring extra SD cards. i've ran into situations where i'm out of storage in the 
                middle of shooting something and it is so frustrating and avoidable. don't get 
                caught lacking.
            </li>
            <li class="tip-example">pay attention to lighting. it's something that i'm working on, but you can 
                have the best equipment and the most optimal camera settings and it all won't 
                mean anything if you have bad lighting messing it all up. lighting is not easy 
                to fix in post, so get it right while recording.
            </li>
        </ul>
